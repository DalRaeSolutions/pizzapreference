# Pizza Preference

A CAP + UI5 demo app for recording employee pizza preferences and building team orders from pasted meeting attendee lists.

## Project layout

| Folder / file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/pizzapreference` | UI5 frontend |
| `db/` | Domain model (`schema.cds`) and CSV seed data |
| `srv/` | `PizzaService` definition and handlers |
| `xs-security.json` | xsuaa scopes, attributes, role templates |
| `package.json` | Node dependencies, CDS config, mocked auth users |
| `mta.yaml` | BTP deployment descriptor |

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
cds watch
```

Open <http://localhost:4004>. Mocked auth is active in dev — log in with any of the users listed below.

## Roles and mocked users

Two role collections:

- **pizzaeater** — records their own standing pizza preference (one row per employee)
- **pizzaorderer** — creates pizza orders from meeting attendee lists

Mocked users in [package.json](package.json) under `cds.requires.auth.users`. Every user has `attr.email`, `attr.displayName`, and `attr.department` populated — in production these come from IAS via xsuaa attribute mappings, locally they're hardcoded.

| User | Password | Roles | Seeded preference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alice` | `alice` | pizzaeater | Vegetarian |
| `bob` | `bob` | pizzaeater | Vegetarian |
| `eater` | `eater` | pizzaeater | Ham and Cheese — *"extra pineapple, thin crust, no olives"* |
| `both` | `both` | pizzaeater + pizzaorderer | Meat Eaters |
| `carol` | `carol` | pizzaorderer | — |
| `dave` | `dave` | pizzaorderer | — |
| `orderer` | `orderer` | pizzaorderer | — |

Standing preferences are pre-seeded from [db/data/dalrae.pizzapreference-EmployeePizza.csv](db/data/dalrae.pizzapreference-EmployeePizza.csv) on each startup (in-memory SQLite resets every reload).

## Demo walkthrough

1. **Log in as an eater** (e.g. `alice` / `alice`) → *My Preference* tab shows her standing Vegetarian preference. Edit or delete it via the modal.
2. **Log in as an orderer** (e.g. `orderer` / `orderer`) → *Team Order* tab is empty. Click **New Order from Meeting**.
3. **Fill the dialog**:
   - **Title**: `Friday lunch — Engineering`
   - **When**: any date
   - **Attendees**: paste the block below
4. **Hit Create Order** → you land on the order details page.

### Demo paste list

Paste this into the **Attendees** textarea:

```
To: Alice Anderson <alice@acme.test>; Bob Barnes <bob@acme.test>; Demo Eater <eater@acme.test>; Brad Smith <both@acme.test>; Frank Foster <frank@acme.test>; Gina Green <gina@acme.test>; Henry Hall <henry@acme.test>
```

At the default `slicesPerPerson = 3` and 8 slices per pizza, the Summary tab should show:

- **Shared pizzas**
  - Vegetarian — 2 people × 3 slices = 6 slices → **1 pizza** (alice + bob)
  - Meat Eaters — 1 person × 3 slices = 3 slices → **1 pizza** (Brad)
- **Custom pizzas**
  - Demo Eater — Ham and Cheese, *"extra pineapple, thin crust, no olives"* → **1 pizza**
- **Capacity gap**
  - 3 attendees with no preference on file (Frank, Gina, Henry) × 3 slices = 9 slices → **2 pizzas** suggested
- **Total: 5 pizzas**

Flick the slice selector in the sub-header:

- **2 slices/person** → the gap collapses to 1 pizza → **Total 4**
- **4 slices/person** → Vegetarian jumps to 2 → **Total 6**

The selector PATCHes the order so your choice persists across reloads.

### Regenerate

Orders are immutable snapshots by default — once created, they don't chase live preference changes. To opt in, hit the **Regenerate** button in the page header (top right of the order details view). It re-matches every existing participant against the current preference pool:

- Unknowns who've since set a preference become matched
- Matched participants pick up their owner's latest choice
- Preferences that have been deleted become unmatched

Try it end to end: create the demo order, log in as `frank` (if you add him as a pizzaeater in [package.json](package.json)) and record a preference, flip back to the orderer, hit **Regenerate** — Frank is now in the Shared pool and the capacity gap drops by one.

### What the demo proves

- **Standing preferences are a pool, not event-bound.** Employees set their preference once.
- **Customisations are personal.** A preference with notes becomes a whole pizza for that person — nobody else wants a slice of weird.
- **Capacity gap for unknowns.** Attendees without a preference on file are counted and sized via the slice formula.
- **Orders are immutable snapshots.** If `alice` changes her preference after an order is created, the existing order still shows what she had at the time. New orders pick up the new preference. Try it: edit alice's preference to Supreme, reload the order — she's still Vegetarian in that order; create a new order with the same paste — she's Supreme.
- **Opt-in regeneration.** Immutability is the default, but the order details page has a **Regenerate** button in the header that re-matches every existing participant against the current preference pool. Attendees who've since set a preference become matched; matched participants pick up their owner's latest choice; preferences that have been deleted become unmatched again. Useful when an orderer builds an order early in the week and wants to refresh it before placing the real order on Friday.
- **Role-gated UI.** Switch between `alice` / `orderer` / `both` to see tabs appear and disappear.
- **Attribute flow.** `createdByName` on an order comes from `req.user.attr.displayName` — the same mechanism that reads an IAS-delivered attribute in production.

## Architecture notes

- **CAP 9.8** backend on Node 20+, SQLite in-memory for dev, HANA for `[production]`
- **OData v2 adapter** via [`@cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter`](https://github.com/cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter) as a cds-plugin, so the UI5 app keeps talking v2 at `/v2/pizza/` while the service itself is v4
- **UI5 1.120** loaded from the SAPUI5 CDN; `@ui5/cli` v4 tooling; `@sap/ux-ui5-tooling` for the dev server
- **Mocked auth** in dev mirrors the xsuaa attribute shape — `req.user.attr.email` works identically in both environments, so no code forks between local and deployed
- **Order snapshotting** — `OrderParticipant` stores `pizza_ID`, `pizzaName`, `pizzaDescription`, `notes` directly (no live association to `EmployeePizza`), so historical orders don't rewrite themselves when standing preferences change

## Productive path (not implemented)

Tier A attendee paste is what's built. The "productive" upgrade path for a real SAP landscape:

- **Microsoft Graph integration** — OAuth into Graph from the BTP backend, read `GET /me/events/{id}/attendees` for a chosen meeting, skip the paste step entirely
- **IAS/IPS wiring** — SCIM provisioning from SuccessFactors or Entra ID into IAS, which then populates `attr.email` / `attr.displayName` / `attr.department` on every token
- **Department-scoped orderers** — use `attr.department` in the orderer's `@restrict` to limit which preferences and orders they can see
